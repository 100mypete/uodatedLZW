I made a arraylist of all the characters in the input file called   inputFileInAnArrayList variable
I then put that through the c+n algorithm and add all the values to   predictionary variable
there is an arraylist of strings called update which is the output that andrew listed in his example chart
i then populated the dictionary(hashmap) and added the vars to that and i also made an inverted key and value dictionary called invertedictionary
I had another array of integers where i went through the update list and turned the value to their corresponding dictionary key and put it into an array of integers called decodedFileUnicodeValues
i then convert decodedFileUnicodeValues to binary and ouput them to the .bin file
